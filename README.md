THis is my third attempt at this supposedly fairly easy tea cozy web landing page. So far i have just figured out the menu and navigation on my own. I know there are answers out there but i want to try to learn to do this on my own. With that said, if anyone can point me in the right direction with positive encouragement and helpful hints that i can glom onto that would be completely appreciated. I am above all a student of the craft and humbly listen to and take all direction in a positive manner. Just please use layman's terms as i am still quite the noob. Thanks for taking time to revies my work.
